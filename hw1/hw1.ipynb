    "The algorithm is based on the fact that for any year, several dates always fall on the same day of the week, called the <em style=\"color:#F00\">doomsday</em> for the year. These dates include 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, and 12/12.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example.__ The doomsday for 2016 is Monday, so in 2016 the dates above all fell on Mondays. The doomsday for 2017 is Tuesday, so in 2017 the dates above will all fall on Tuesdays.\n",
